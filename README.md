Given that you have a table “Books” populated with the book’s ISBN number, title and a description, write the code and SQL query to create the following HTML output.   You should list the full alphabet, only underlining/linking letters than have titles starting with that letter.  Clicking on a letter should bring you to that Letter Header above the book listings, and each letter header should only be listed once.  Clicking on the title of the book will bring the user to a page giving the title and description of the book.  You only need to write the code for this page below.  You can submit your response in any language or pseudo code you’d like.

Hint 1:  You can accomplish the database portion with one query and only one call to the database if written efficiently with performance in mind.
Hint 2:  You should be able to accomplish this in less than 50 lines of code, all inclusive.
